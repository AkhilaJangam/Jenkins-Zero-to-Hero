  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins

** Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.
EC2 > Instances > Click on
In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
Security groups
Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed All traffic).

Yes, by default, Jenkins uses port 8080 for its web interface. When you install Jenkins on a server, it is typically configured to run on this port, which allows you to access the Jenkins dashboard via a web browser using a URL like http://<your-server-ip>:8080.

Summary:
Default Port: 8080 is the default port for Jenkins.
Web Interface: This port is used to serve the Jenkins web interface, where you can manage your Jenkins jobs, configurations, and plugins.
Customization: You can change the default port if needed, but 8080 is the standard port assigned during installation.
If Jenkins is properly installed and running on your server, you should be able to access it using the public IP or DNS of your server, followed by :8080 in your web browser.

How jenkins work in real world

Architecture 



Jenkins Master -->created on Ec2 instance 

Resume point: we have used docker as agent in our jenkins project setup and we have found it very useful interms of cost and efficiency
and spinning up and tearing down the docker containers.
